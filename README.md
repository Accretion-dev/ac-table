# json extract syntax
assume we have a complex json array, with these root fields
* name: String
* int: Number
* aS: array of String, or null
* aD: array of Date, or null
* aN: array of Number, or null
* aSND: array of (String|Number|Date), or null
* aSNDAO: array of (String|Number|Date|Array|Object), or null
* aaa0: array of (Array of Object, or null), or null
* o: Object
in the nested Array or Object, some of them also have these fields

we define a `json extract syntax(JES)` to quickly extract deep fields of a random json

* operators:
  * `@object`,`@array`,`@string`,`@number`,`@date`,`@null`: only extract value of this types
    * when the string is a ISO date format(YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss), it will be extract as a date
  * `>`: inside a array
* examples:
  * `field`: extract the `field` field of current data
  * `@type`: extract the field of current data only if its type is `type`, or will return undefined
  * `>`: the 'go into' operator for array
    * '.a' return the array 'a'
    * if '.a' is a root field
      * '.a>' return a array than contains all values in 'a' (its value is the same as '.a', but have different meaning, e.g., '.a@array' and '.a>@array' have different meaning). return undefined if 'a' is a empty array or 'a' is not an array
      * '.a>>' flatten the arrays in '.a' once
      * '.a>>>' flatten the arrays in '.a' twice
      * ....
    * if '.a' is not a root field
      * '.a>' flatten the arrays in '.a' once
      * '.a>>' flatten the arrays in '.a' twice
      * ....
  * `.subfield`
    * if current data is an object, extract the `subfield`
    * if current data is an array: map its values as below, if not return undefined
      * if the value is an object, extract `subfield` and map, or map undefined
      * if the values in the mapped array are all undefined, retrun undefined

    extract by 'a0.a0value' ==> 123
    extract by 'a0.a0value@number' ==> 123
    extract by 'a0.a0value@string' ==> undefined

    extract by 'a1>@number' ==> [10]
    extract by 'a1>@date' ==> ['2000-01-01T00:00:00']

    extract by 'a1.a2' or
    extract by 'a1>.a2' or
    extract by 'a1>@object.a2' ==> [[20, 'a2_abc'], [21, 'a2_xyz']]
    extract by 'a1.a2>' ==> [20, 'a2_abc', 21, 'a2_xyz']
    extract by 'a1.a2>@number' ==> [20, 21]
    extract by 'a1.a2>@string' ==> ['a2_abc', 'a2_xyz']
    extract by 'a1>@array' ==> [ [21,'abc'], [22,{a3: [30,'a3_abc']}]]
    extract by 'a1>>' or
    extract by 'a1>@array>' ==> [ 21,'abc', 22, {a3: [30,'a3_abc']}]
    extract by 'a1>>@object.a3' or
    extract by 'a1>>.a3' ==> [[30,'a3_abc']]
    extract by 'a1>>.a3>' ==> [30,'a3_abc']
    extract by 'a1>>.a3>@number' ==> [30]
    extract by 'a1>>.a3>@string' ==> ['a3_abc']
    extract by 'a1>>.a3>@date' ==> undefined

    a much more complex example is shown in the test suite
